/**
  * Use pattern matching and recursion.  No vars, no loops, no overriding.
  *
  * `Option` is an implementation of optional functionality.
  *
  * We've made these exercises to give you greater insight into how an optional pattern
  * might work in a functional language.
  *
  * When you see `Option` think: "It may exist, or it may not"
  *
  * There are two ways to construct an `Option`:
  *
  *   `Some()` represents something that exists
  *
  *   `None` represents something that doesn't exist
  *
  * We use `Option` in situations where there isn't certainty that a meaningful
  * value will be returned to us.
  *
  *   The `get()` method on the key to value store `Map` is a great example of this.
  *
  *     We expect `get()` to take a key and give us a value in return.
  *
  *     But what happens when our Map doesn't know about the key we gave it?
  *
  *   A Map here is the same as in any other language,
  *   we just need to tell it about the types we're working with.
  *
  *     This is the type of the key
  *                      |
  *                      |     This is the type of the value
  *                      |      |
  *                      |      |
  *     val myMap = Map[Int, String]( 1 -> "one", 2 -> "two, ...)
  *
  *
  *   When we call `get()` on Map we will always get back an `Option` type
  *
  *     myMap.get(1) = Some("one")  //The value exists and it's the string "one"
  *
  *     myMap.get(0) = None      //The value doesn't exist so we get None
  *
  *   `Some("one")` and `None` are both of the type Option
  *
  *   Since `Some` and `None` are the same type we can pattern match on them!
  *
  *   We can have one set of logic when we get Some back and a different set
  *   of logic when we get `None` back!
  *
  *   val mightBeSomething: Option[String] = myMap.get(3)
  *
  *   val result: String = mightBeSomething match {
  *     case Some(string) => "I got a String back!"
  *     case None => "I got None back"
  *   }
  *
  * Good luck!
